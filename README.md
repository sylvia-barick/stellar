# Nexus-Shield: AI-Driven Cross-Border Trade & Compliance Engine

## Project Overview

Nexus-Shield is a next-generation Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) platform designed to bridge the "Trust Gap" in international trade. Developed for the TechTriad Hackathon, the platform addresses the fragmentation and risks associated with manual cross-border contracting by providing a unified, secure, and intelligent workbench.

By integrating modern web workflows, AI-driven compliance sentinel, and the Stellar blockchain, Nexus-Shield ensures that every contract is transparent, tamper-proof, and audit-ready.

## Core Integrated Themes
### 1. Contract Management Workbench (Web UI/UX)
Designed using Next.js, the workbench serves as a modern command center for managing contracts throughout their lifecycle:


   **● Interactive Dashboard:** View key metrics, status updates, and alerts surfaced from AI and blockchain layers.

   **● Version Management:** Track every edit and version change with a clear visual history.

   **● Role-Based Workflow:** Secure approval flows for creators, reviewers, and approvers.

### 2. AI-Assisted Contract Intelligence
A proactive AI engine that assists users in understanding and managing complex legal obligations:


   **● Risk Sentinel:** Automatically flags unusual or missing clauses and provides explanations for potential cross-border legal risks.


   **● Clause Extraction:** Structures important data such as payment terms, liability, and termination conditions.


   **● Contextual Q&A:** A grounded assistant that provides instant answers based strictly on the content of the uploaded contract.


### 3. Blockchain-Backed Trust & Auditability
Utilizes the Stellar Blockchain as a decentralized trust layer to provide immutable proof of contract integrity:


   **● Document Anchoring:** Stores cryptographic hashes of every contract version on the Stellar ledger, enabling instant verification that a document has not been altered.


   **● Immutable Audit Trail:** Provides a verifiable, time-stamped history of all approvals and signatures recorded on-chain.


   **● High-Speed Finality:** Leverages Stellar’s efficiency to provide cost-effective and near-instant verification for enterprise scaling.


## Technology Stack

   **• Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.


   **•Intelligence:** LLM-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for grounded analysis.


   **•Trust Layer:** Stellar Network, Soroban Smart Contracts, Stellar SDK.


## How It Works

   **•Drafting:** Users create or upload contracts into the high-fidelity workbench.


   **•Analysis:** The AI sentinel extracts clauses and highlights jurisdictional risks in real-time.


   **•Verification:** The current state of the document is hashed and anchored to the Stellar Blockchain to create a "Trust Lock".


   **•Execution:** Parties sign milestones recorded immutably on-chain, creating a forensic audit trail for global compliance.
